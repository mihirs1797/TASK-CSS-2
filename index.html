        <h3>Visual Creativity</h3>
        <p>There's more visual freedom in parallax website design. Rather than <br>
        focusing on block style information architecture, you can create <br>refreshing
        and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful <br>photography, that act as a continuum,
        ultimately inspiring users to <br>scroll further down the page.</p>  
        </div>

          <h1 class="header">STORY TELLING OPPORTUNITIES</h1>        
        <p>Do you want to tell a story with your product or service? <br>
        Long-scrolling lends itself well to a narrative and <br>
        encourages meaningful interaction from users.</p>

        <p>Do you want to tell a story with your product or service? <br>

          <h1 class="header">PUNCHY, STRAIGHT TO THE POINT MESSAGING</h1>        
        <p>Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor <br>
          website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their <br>
          message and vision into one dynamic web design page. </p>

          <h1 class="header">FASIER FOR USERS TO <br> REALISE THEIR GOAL</h1>        
        <p>These days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an <br>
          instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page <br>
          requires thought and motivation. A single page website <br>
          allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker, <br>
          than needing to sift through multiple pages.</p>

          <h1 class="header">LONG SCROLL: THE NOT SO GOOD STUFF</h1>
        <h3>YOU NEED TO BE SEARCH ENGINE SAVVY</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that <br>
          they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of <br>
          pages on your website. Google has fewer pages to index and <br> 
          negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results <br>
          page (SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.</p>

        <div class="content-left">
          <h1 class="header">SLOWER LOAD TIMES</h1>        
        <p>50% of websites bounce off the page if it hasn't loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the <br>
          more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to <br>
          load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax <br>
          websites and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to <br>
          load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites <br>
          loaded within a few seconds.</p>

        <div class="content-right">
          <h1 class="header">Awkward Navigation</h1>
        <p>Instead of hitting the 'back' button, users must scroll back <br>
          up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to <br>
          refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is <br>
          to include top navigation and have each element anchored <br>
        to a category or section.</p>
